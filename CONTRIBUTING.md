# The Contributing Guide

## Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses the [Conventional Commits][conventionalcommits] specification for commit messages. This specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
